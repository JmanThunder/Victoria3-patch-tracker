# This file basically determines which folders are available to be loaded at a lower resolution.
# all *.dds files will be loaded in at a lower resolution. png & tga files are kept at same resolution
# The order of the directories here matter, the first time a texture is loaded determins what setting they will use. So you want it to start with specifics, then go more global as you move down the list.
# The array signifies how many mipmaps will be skipped loading at low/medium/high/ultra quality

# Specific stuff on top, algorithm will stop at first hit
